# jkr

This directory contains JKR data and the script to convert JKR data
into OCDS-JKR data that follow at least OCDS schema version 1.0.

## JKR data

JKR data are the JSONL files used as source data. Each JSONL file
contains one JSON object (in JKR source format) per line. 

Files: `jkr*.jsonl`

## OCDS-JKR data

OCDS-JKR data are the JSONL files generated by the script. Each JSONL
file contains one JSON object (in OCDS record format) per line.

Files: `ocds-jkr*.jsonl`

## Script usage

The script will convert all source data to OCDS record format.

    $ python jkr_to_ocds.py

The script will look for matching files (`jkr*.jsonl`) in the
specified directory (`data`) and process each file accordingly.

New files with `ocds-` prefix will be created if new source data has
been added. Any existing generated files with `ocds-` prefix will be
overwritten with new data.

## Script requirements

Python 2.7+ or Python 3.4+
